# Minesweeper

This is my very first Java GUI project using JavaFX. It is simply the game ***Minesweeper*** as you already know it. Below are the installers for each operating system, therefore no prior installation is needed. 

**Download installers here:**
- for MacOS: <a href="https://julien.barrea.lu/projects/Minesweeper-1_0-macos_arm64.dmg">Minesweeper-1_0-macos_arm64.dmg</a>
- for Windows: <a href="https://julien.barrea.lu/projects/Minesweeper-1_0-win_x64.exe">Minesweeper-1_0-win_x64.exe</a>
      <p style="color:red">***WARNING : the windows installer works, however there are currently not shortcut created which means that you will only find the program in the directory C:\Program Files\Minesweeper***</p>
- for Linux: Coming Soon
